# Why Use react-forminate?

Creating forms in React is often repetitive, verbose, and hard to scale ‚Äî especially when dealing with dynamic requirements, complex validation, API-driven fields, or deeply nested structures.

**React Forminate** solves this by offering a **declarative, JSON-based form engine** that is flexible, extensible, and developer-friendly.

---

## üß± Traditional Forms Are Painful

With regular React forms, you might run into:

- Boilerplate code repeated across projects
- Manual wiring of state, validation, and error handling
- Fragile form logic that breaks as requirements change
- Difficulty managing dynamic fields, dependencies, or API data
- Poor scalability when forms become large and complex

---

## ‚úÖ React Forminate Solves This

### 1. **Write Less, Do More**

Define your entire form structure with a simple JSON schema. No more writing tons of `useState`, `useEffect`, or error handlers for every input.

### 2. **Dynamic by Default**

Support dynamic fields, conditionally visible sections, and values fetched from APIs ‚Äî out of the box.

### 3. **Built-In Validation**

Use built-in validators or plug in your own logic. Field-level and form-level validation are both supported.

### 4. **Composable Field System**

Choose from built-in field types like `SelectField`, `GridViewField`, or extend with your own components.

### 5. **First-Class TypeScript Support**

Intelligent autocompletion, schema type safety, and strong tooling support across your editor and build tools.

### 6. **CLI That Works For You**

Scaffold boilerplate with `npx forminate init` or add fields via `npx forminate add`. Even extend functionality using the plugin system.
