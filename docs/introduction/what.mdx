# What is react-forminate?

A short and sweet overview of the library. Highlight that itâ€™s a dynamic JSON-driven form builder built for React.

**React Forminate** is a powerful, flexible, and fully extensible **form builder library** built for React and Next.js projects. It allows developers to define form structure, behavior, and layout using a simple and intuitive **JSON schema**, while leveraging TypeScript for robust typing and developer experience.

Whether you're building dynamic dashboards, admin panels, or data-driven interfaces, React Forminate lets you create **complex forms without boilerplate code** â€” all while staying maintainable and composable.

## ðŸ§© Built For Modularity

React Forminate is structured in a modular way:

- **Core:** Form state, validation logic, schema parsing
- **Fields:** Built-in and custom components like `SelectField`, `GridViewField`, etc.
- **Plugins:** Optional enhancements such as `SwitchField`, new field types, or layout utilities

---

## ðŸ”§ When Should You Use It?

Use React Forminate if:

- You're building forms that frequently change over time.
- You want non-devs or product teams to define forms using JSON.
- You need to support forms with API-driven fields or field dependencies.
- You want consistent form behavior across projects without copy-pasting UI logic.

## ðŸ§  Think: Headless UI for Forms

Much like how **headless CMS** separates content from presentation, **React Forminate separates form logic from rendering**, allowing full control over UI while abstracting away the heavy lifting of state, validation, and interaction.
