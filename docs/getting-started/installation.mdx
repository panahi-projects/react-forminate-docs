# 🚀 Installation

React Forminate is available as an open-source package on npm. You can install it in any modern React or Next.js project using your preferred package manager.

---

### 📦 Install via NPM or Yarn

```bash
npm install react-forminate
```
or

```bash
yarn add react-forminate
```

### 🔧 Peer Dependencies
React Forminate requires the following peer dependencies to work properly:

- React `^18.0.0` or later
- TypeScript (optional but strongly recommended)

If you're using a framework like Next.js, you're already good to go!

### 🛠️ Project Setup
Once installed, you're ready to start building forms using the core components:

- Wrap your form with the `FormProvider` if needed
- Use `useForm()` to access and manage form state
- Define your form schema (JSON or JavaScript object)
- Render fields with `DynamicForm`
