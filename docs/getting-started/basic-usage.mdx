# Basic Usage

Getting started with **React Forminate** is straightforward. All you need is a simple form schema and the `DynamicForm` component.

---

### âœ¨ Quick Start Example

Hereâ€™s a minimal example to help you hit the ground running:

<Code2 />

### ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- `DynamicForm`: Renders the form based on the provided `formData` schema.
- `formData`: A JSON object that defines the fields, labels, types, and validation rules.
- `onSubmit`: A callback function that receives the form values and a validity flag when the user submits the form.

### âœ… Notes

- There's no need to manually manage state â€” `react-forminate` handles it internally.
- This setup does not require wrapping in `FormProvider` unless you're using `useForm()` manually.
- You can customize styles and field behavior as needed â€” see the Field Components and Customization sections for more advanced use cases.
