# Basic Usage

Getting started with **React Forminate** is straightforward. All you need is a simple form schema and the `DynamicForm` component.

---

### âœ¨ Quick Start Example

Hereâ€™s a minimal example to help you hit the ground running:

<Code2 
      description="Simple form example with name, email, and date fields using React-Forminate, featuring validation and submission handling."
      features={[
        "Multiple field types (text, date)",
        "Required field validation",
        "Form submission handling",
        "Type-safe form schema",
        "Console logging for debugging"
      ]}
      keywords={[
        "React form example",
        "form validation",
        "DynamicForm demo",
        "form schema",
        "required fields",
        "form submission",
        "React-Forminate tutorial"
      ]}
/>

### ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- `DynamicForm`: Renders the form based on the provided `formData` schema.
- `formData`: A JSON object that defines the fields, labels, types, and validation rules.
- `onSubmit`: A callback function that receives the form values and a validity flag when the user submits the form.

### âœ… Notes

- There's no need to manually manage state â€” `react-forminate` handles it internally.
- This setup does not require wrapping in `FormProvider` unless you're using `useForm()` manually.
- You can customize styles and field behavior as needed â€” see the Field Components and Customization sections for more advanced use cases.
